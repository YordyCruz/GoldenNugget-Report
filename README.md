# Golden Nugget 

Within the attached report on the Golden Nugget Casino, you will find the analysis and breakdown of the hotel’s website. This report will highlight the ways in which the website is effective as well as ineffective in reaching out to a broader audience. 

Our analysis included researching the Golden Nugget’s website and comparing it to other casino websites such as the Cosmopolitan that had a more effective layout. Research also included research into the background of the casino and the patterns associated with the tourists. We have created a poll and consulted a group of people of ranging ages and backgrounds to see their perspective on the website. This information has been compiled and made into graphs to outline the views efficiently. With our findings, we have concluded that there are several ways to improve the usability of the website to create a bigger impact on viewers. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider our analysis on the Golden Nugget Casino and the research we compiled along with it. Please review the report and the research and let us know your thoughts.

If you have any additional questions or comments, feel free to contact any of the group members listed. The suggested person to contact will be Edward Kim as he is the leader of the group. We look forward to hearing your feedback. 

Sincerely, 
Jade Poole, Edward Kim Yordy Cruz, and Kaitlyn Prerost
